# VSCode - Evolution

## 1. History and Evolution

- Visual studio code was originaly intended to be an online code editor. Where developers can code and run their codes online. The final decision was to create a desktop application which could be usefull to code in TypeScript and C# only. Also, the developer team created a debugger for coding purposes. All this was made during the beta version of Visual Studio Code which was not open source. Some months later, Visual Studio Code was launched in a more official way, with new functionalities that lasts until today and make Visual Studio Code what it is: The most used code editor. Some of these functionalities are Extension support, the new architecture and the launched it as an open source software.
The current repository does not have the complete history of vscode, but it has information since 2016, where all the main functionalities were established.
